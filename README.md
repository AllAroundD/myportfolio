# myportfolio
This is a place to share my portfolio and journey as a developer

## Description
This is my site to share my portfolio of projects and contact information.

## Link to Deployed Application
https://allaroundd.github.io/myportfolio/

## Usage
- There are 3 links at the top of the page (About, Portfolio, Contact).
- The About link provides a little description of myself and includes links to my Portfolio, Contact, and PDF resume.
- The Portfolio link showcases my recent GitHub projects with links to both the deployed applications and GitHub repository locations.
- The Contact link shows a work in progress contact form. I included a modal to explain it is not yet functional. 
- Buttons to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are located at the bottom of the page.

## Site Features
- This website includes a bio of me, portfolio of GitHub repositories including my group project1 and a few pinned in my profile.
- Bootstrap is used for responsiveness and support of different devices.
- Once user scrolls down page, an arrow appears to be able to scroll back up to the top of the page.
- The site is styled by CSS to brand the site.
- The About Me section includes a link to my resume in PDF.
- The original html pages were combined into one html page and segmented by sections.


## What I Learned
It was a challenge to come up with a design to make the site look polished. Learning how to incoporate Bootstrap really helped put things together. Some of the components were challenging making it mobile-friendly.
